<h1>Letter</h1>
Hi, heerack. <strong>How are you doing with your assignment?</strong>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/">I'm trying hard to imitate coding.</a>
I'm worried that it's bigger than I thought, but try hard.
<strong><u>Let's do our homework and go to sleep.</U></strong>
<br><br><br>
What time do you have to go to school tomorrow?
<br><u>Do you feel hungry when you study in the morning?</u>
<br>I'm writing English because it's not written in Korean.
<p>I'm sure I'll be going to work out tomorrow morning.
<br>I should exercise in the morning, go to class, have lunch, study, and go to a meeting in the evening.</p>
